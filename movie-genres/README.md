# The Movie Genres Challenge

The directory contains two files:

* Movie metadata - movieid, movie, language, genre, etc. The first column is the movie id.
* Plot summary - movieid and plot summary of the movie

Use these two files to explore and analyze this dataset. Provide detailed exploratory analysis.

From the exploratory analysis can you build a Machine learning/ Deep learning models to predict the genres better. Also provide reasons if possible on why you chose a specific model.
